Basic Trivia Game


Basic trivia game that utilized jQuery, timers, and radio buttons. After initially creating the code out of a lot of html, I worked
to reduce the HTML into jQuery calls that to populate questions, answers, elements, classes, and id's from jQuery. I would like to
revisit the project to clean up much of this that creates the code a bit more hectic and sloppy than I would have preferred.
